# DESCRIPTION
This simple program is built on top of classifier model which, given a text message, can funnel it down in the most proper categories.

It is thought to be used in emergency situations of various kind, when there are posted thousands of messages indicating the nature of a specific need or trouble, or sended directely.

Classify quickly every message can help to speed up the process of helping the needing people. If every organization receive only the messages regarding their own area, each one has to read less messages and faster knowing how and where to act.

After this first automated clean the messages still need a final human check, but it helps.
